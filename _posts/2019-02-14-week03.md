title: Week 3 - Browser Extension Summary
---

I am pretty satisfied with the extension we made and the collaboration between me and my teammates. I think we did a really good job of getting to know each other's specialty and then dividing the tasks based on that. Due to some schedule issues, we didn't have a chance to meet in person to discuss and work on this project; if we do, we might come up with more ideas or add more features. We mainly communicated using Slack, therefore, sometimes we cannot respond to each other immediately, but in general, our teamwork is productive and yields a good result.

Working in a teams makes me realize the importance of honest communication, especially when sharing opions and progresses.

I really enjoyed watching other groups' presentation. It was a lot of fun, especially seeing them advertising for their "product". The coin flip one impressed me a lot because I didn't know you can create such cool animations using only CSS.

This is my first time working on an open source project. The idea of other people can contribute to our project is still fairly new and unfamiliar. It is also very interesting to look at other group's code and find something I like and want to contribute, which is a good starting point for getting involved in the open source community.
