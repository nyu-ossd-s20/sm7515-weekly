title: Week 5
---

reflect on your goals for open source contributions, your skills and your interests in the taking_stock repository in the course organization (you should see your own private repository for this)
make your week 5 blog post
reflect on the project evaluations that were completed in class: what did you learn? what was challenging and why? do you think you are ready to select a project to contribute to?
reflect on the invited talk: what did you learn? what was surprising/unexpected? what was interesting? did your view of the interaction of open source projects and large companies change?
comment on your contributions (make sure that you are recording them in the contributions page on your blog)
