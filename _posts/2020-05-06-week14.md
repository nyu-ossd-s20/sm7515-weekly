title: Week 14 End Of The Semester Reflection

It's a wrap...

### Final Thoughts
  
  I think I have talked about this for a million times, but I have to say it one last time in this final blog post that we are really lucky to come across p5.js and decide to work on it for this whole semester. This friendly, active and welcoming community and the overall positive experience with them definitely make my life a lot easier as a first-timer open source contributor. Especially compared to other groups where they need to set up a specific environment, we don't need to install or use any extra environment or tools. 
  At first, I was intimidated by the project because even though I have experience with web development before, I have never worked with yml or grunt before and worked on a project that at this scale. But luckily, they have a section dedicated to explain their file structure.
