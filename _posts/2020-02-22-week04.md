title: Week 4 - Reflections on open data
---

The talk given by Deena and Vicky on Open Data introduced me to the field of data anaylysis. I learned a lot about what languages and tools people use for analyzing data, where to look for open data and things we should be careful of when handling data. 

I mainly worked in DevOps teams before where I write code to build apps and the whole team focuses on developing a product; therefore, it is interesting to know the role of programmers in a research team. In a research team, the programmers write code to analyze data; when the subject of the research is outside the field of computer science like neuroscience or psychology, then the programmers understand little about the significance of the result. This is very different from my experience in DevOps teams, where programmers have a lot of knowledge and control over the work they do.

The sources Deena and Vicky introduced for finding good and well-documented open data are very helpful. I struggle with finding usable data and APIs for my projects a lot in the past. After listening to their talks, I have a clear mind of how to search for the information I want and what website to search from in the first place.

I wish they bring up more examples of working with open data and some interesting projects that use open data. Overall, I  enjoyed their speeches very much.
