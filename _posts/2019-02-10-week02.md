title: Week 2 - Browser Extension
---

Our group decided to make an extension that changes based on time. If it is day time, the extension that lights up the website is off; if it is night time, then the extension is automatically on. One can also turn it on or off freely.

I have some experiences with JavaScript before, so I work on the coding side. Teammate who doesn't know how to code in JavaScript works on the documentation part.

By working on this project, I learned how to write firefox extension, which I have wanted to learn for a long time and I also became more comfortable with writing in JavaScript.
