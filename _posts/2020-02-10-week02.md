title: Week 2 - Browser Extension
---

Our group decided to make an extension that changes the browser's theme based on time. If it is day time, the theme would be have lighter color; if it is night time, then the theme would be darker. One can also turn it on or off freely.

I have some experiences with JavaScript before, so I work on the coding side, implementing functions and adding styles. Teammate who doesn't know how to code in JavaScript works on the documentation part.

By working on this project, I learned how to write firefox extension, which I have wanted to learn for a long time. Before, I kind of only deal with the document object and the window object; this exercise introduces me to the browser object as well.
