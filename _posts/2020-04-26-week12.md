### Business Models

This week I was introduced to the business models that open source projects normally use, which is very informative. 

Before, I thought the only source for open source projects to earn money and profit is via donation or sponsorship. So I always think that people join the open source community not to make money, but because they really love programming and driven by dream or passion. 

After taking this course and listening to the talks from some great guest speakers, I know more about the idea of open source, what and why people choose it. Making contributions gives me the chance to communicate with the core people from a big project, like p5.js. Before, I can only imagine me learning how to use it by watching youtube videos or google. By making contributions, I am able to talk to and improve my knowledge from these senior programmers who are doing the kind of work that I wish to do after graduation.

Now, I feel more involved with the programming community. This is like a transition zone from a naive computer science undergraduate to a professional computer programmer.
