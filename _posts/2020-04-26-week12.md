### Business Models

This week I was introduced to the business models that open source projects normally use, which is very informative. 

Before, I thought the only source for open source projects to earn money and profit is via donation or sponsorship. So I always think that people join the open source community not to make money, but because they really love programming and driven by dream or passion. 

After taking this course and listening to the talks from some great guest speakers, I know more about the idea of open source, what and why people choose it. Now, I feel more involved with the online programming community after making some comtributions.
